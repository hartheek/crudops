This is a full-stack application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their name and university details. The frontend is built using Next.js, and the backend is powered by Nest.js, a framework for building efficient and scalable Node.js applications.

Key Features
Create: Add new user details (name and university).
Read: Fetch existing user details by ID.
Update: Modify existing user details.
Delete: Remove user details from the database.
The frontend displays a simple form pre-populated with the user's current name and university details. Users can modify these details and submit the form to update them. The data is then processed through the backend, which handles the CRUD operations and communicates with the database.

The Next.js frontend communicates with the Nest.js backend through RESTful API calls. The backend is responsible for fetching, updating, and deleting user records stored in the database.

Technologies Used
Frontend: Next.js 
Backend: Nest.js 
Database: PostgreSQL for storing user details
This project demonstrates how to create a full-stack web application using Next.js for the frontend and Nest.js for the backend, enabling users to manage their personal details with a clean and responsive form interface.
